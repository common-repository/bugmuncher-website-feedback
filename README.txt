**What Is Saber?**

Saber is the website feedback tool you've been looking for, easy to use, quick to set up, and free! 

Saber adds a customizable feedback button to your website allowing visitors to submit feedback and report issues. Best of all Saber automatically pulls relevant information for you, such as the browser, operating system, errors and more. 

**Why Do I Need Saber?**

Bugs decrease conversions and annoy users. Using the Saber Feedback form is like having your own quality assurance team, except it's your users! And there's no better tester than end users; Saber makes it easy to facilitate user feedback and follow up on it. 

Customer feedback is essential, without it, it's like the blind leading the blind. With it, you open up new possibilities and an endless world of potential improvements. 

**The short of it?**

 * Increase conversions by contacting users who reported issues
 * Fix site breaking issues preventing checkouts from working, signups and more
